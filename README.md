The purpose of this project is to learn how to use the Django REST framework to allow for secure communication between a Django backend and a React frontend.
This web app allows a user to create reminders or "todo" notes.
  The React frontend allows for a reactive and elegant design whilst the Django backend controls the storage of users and notes.
  This project allowed me to solidify my knowledge of authorization and authentication using Django and communication between a client and host using a RESTful API.
  HTTP requests are handled using Axios and JWT authentication.
